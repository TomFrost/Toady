# Toady
Wickedly extensible IRC bot written in Node.js.  Load and reload mods without reconnecting.

## Download. Install. Fly.
If you don't already have Node.js, [get it](http://nodejs.org). It's awesome.
And also required.

Then, grab Toady from Github by using the [download link](https://github.com/TomFrost/Toady/archive/master.zip),
or if you're dev-minded and like to stay updated, clone it on the command line:

	git clone git@github.com:TomFrost/Toady.git

Get into that folder on the command line and install:

    npm install

## Configure it. Just a little bit.
Copy config/default.yaml.sample to config/default.yaml.  Enter your server
settings, change Toady's name, and pay extra careful attention to the section
marked with

    ## !!IMPORTANT!! ##

Because four exclamation points means business, son.

## You turn Toady on.
To launch (from the Toady directory) on any non-Windows machine, or Cygwin:

    ./ribbit start

If you're on Windows, it's:

    ribbit.cmd start

Need to launch it on more than one server? Just copy config/default.yaml to
config/myotherserver.yaml, edit it for the new server, and launch
Toady like this:

    ./ribbit start myotherserver

When he's in your channel, do this in IRC for more info:

    /msg Toady help

## Teach Toady new tricks.
Toady can be extended through simple mods, and mods can make Toady do
practially anything.  Mods can be searched for, installed, and uninstalled
through ribbit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: This section shows you how to install third-party mods.
These are not moderated, maintained, guaranteed, or otherwise vetted by
Toady's author.  Install at your own risk, as mods are capable of anything!**

List all Toady mods:

    ./ribbit search

List only mods that deal with typos:

    ./ribbit search typo

Install a mod:

    ./ribbit install typofix

Uninstall a mod:

    ./ribbit uninstall typofix

## Write your own mods! (It's easy)
I'll have docs here on how to write awesome mods soon, but until then, here's
what's up: almost ALL of Toady's functionality, including setting user
permissions, making him talk in a channel, and even executing all the commands,
is done in mods.  Check out the app/coremods folder and poke around.  The
documentation there is thorough, and provides great examples on what all a
mod can do.  Hint: anything.

For now, just know that all user-written mods should go in the 'mods' folder,
and they can be in any format that Node.js's require() can handle.  However,
I strongly recommend putting each mod in its own folder, and having the main
file be named `index.js` or point to the main file in your package.json.
The reasoning behind this is in the next section!

## Distribute your mods on ribbit
To get your mods on ribbit, all you need to do is publish your mod to NPM
under the following name:

    toady-mod_name_here

So if your mod is named 'typofix', your mod's package.json should contain
this line:

    "name": "toady-typofix"

Don't have a package.json yet? Just type `npm init` in your mod's directory
and follow the prompts, giving it the "toady-" prefixed name when it asks.

If you haven't already done it, run `npm adduser` to log in (or make an
account) on NPM, and then run `npm publish` to give your mod to the world.
It should show up in ribbit searches within a few minutes.

## Toady has a lawyer
Toady is distributed under the BSD license.  See the 'LICENSE.txt' file for the
legalese.  It's friendly and open, I promise.

## Toady has a purpose in life
I wrote Toady in 2013 to help manage my dev team's IRC room. There are other
bots, but this is the magical mix of features that few of the others had:
- Written in Javascript, so practically anyone can extend it
- Dead-simple command framework, so new commands are no more than a few lines of code away
- Can develop on it and test mods without restarting (/msg Toady viewmod modcontrol)
- Can restrict its commands by its own global permissions as well as channel and NickServ permissions on the IRC server itself
- Since it's Node.js, making mods do crazy stuff like hosting websites to view channel logs right within Toady is as simple as `npm install express`
